    "The purpose of this document is twofold: present the comprehensive methodology for efficiently estimating travel time network distances and illustrating its usage. Specifically, we create an open-source backend infrastructure for estimating travel time network distances (walking, driving, and <span style=\"color:magenta\"> **(PENDING)** <span style=\"color:black\"> biking and transit) and providing the framework for calculating accessibility and coverage scores. The accesibility score focuses on the attributes of the origins while the coverage score focuses on the attributes from the destinations of interest. Moreover, this framework also allows subsetting of the data according to the user's specific questions of interest. These analyses create a powerful tool for supporting stakeholders and researchers in improving transparent decision-making processes and in understanding the issues of unequal spatial access.\n",

    "Why is this method better? This method comprehensively measures access more efficiently under an open-source framework compared to the extant state of the art options such as Valhalla and OSRM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating large shortest path matrices for different transit types is an important tool for spatial data science, but does not currently have a solution that is open source, highly scalable and efficient. Several tools currently exist which fill a similar purpose to this software package. OSRM, Valhalla and Google Maps, among other services, offer matrix APIs to compute the shortest path distance for datasets but the open-source solutions break down when applied to very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above services caps the number of entries in a request at 25-50, meaning that generating a matrix with 500,000 rows requires breaking the original matrix into millions of submatrices and making millions of individual queries. This approach works well for small datasets, but includes substantial overhead which is prohibitive on a large scale. The point to point shortest path algorithm (p2p) can generate matrices between a set of source and destination points (or source-source) in 2 lines of code, efficiently and with a low memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code generates a driving shortest path matrix for 46,265 blocks in Chicago in ~14 minutes (18 minutes for walking) whereas the same task took > 18 hours using MapZen's Valhalla. For this particular dataset, the mean difference between time values for the driving shortest path matrix and Google Maps' Matrix API is 2 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, there are two routes the user can take for getting the travel distances: Creating **symmetric** or **asymmetric** matrices. As mentioned above, symmetric matrices are estimated source to source, while asymmetric matrices calculate origin to destination. The user can generate a symmetric distance travel matrix and snap the points of interest to the matrix or create an asymmetric distance matrix that already incorporates origin and destination. The symmetric approach is more appropriate when you need to calculate several scores (across years or different types of scores) for the same area and at the same level of analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the distance travel times from origins to destinations (in this case, from the centroids of blocks to the health facilities), the user can calculate the access score from each block to health facilities or the destination coverage score. Moreover, it is important to emphasize that the following framework allows the user to generate any type of score, suiting each person's needs.  \n"

    "The **pyTMatrix** generates the environment in Python for estimating the time travel matrix by creating a wrapper for C++. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Framework for p2p algorithm:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **TransitMatrix** unified class manages all aspects of computing a transit time matrix where matrices can be symmetric or assymetric (as mentioned above). Therefore, load one input file if the user wants a symmetric distance graph, or two for an asymmetric matrix. Particularly, this class account for all the details that entail specifying the speed limits, creating the bounding box for the area of interest in order to run the OSM query and calculate the shortest path matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the network distance matrix, first, the code extracts the extreme value of latitude/longitude from the source input table to create a bounding box of the area of interest. The size of the bounding box is increased by 'epsilon', to avoid cutting off the network of datapoints near the boundary of the bounding box. Please view the epsilon calibration to assess the appropriate value of epsilon for each estimation. <span style=\"color:magenta\"> **(PENDING)**\n",
    "\n",
    "OSM's data structure is composed of four elements: nodes, ways, relations, and tags.\n",
    "Nodes are latitude and longitude coordinates (projected in WGS 84) that represent the map’s features. Ways are a list of nodes that compose the geometry features (i.e. point, line, polygon) within a map, depicting streets, waterways, parks, etc. Relations express the relationship between nodes and ways. Lastly, tags are attached to nodes, mays or relations, storing metadata about the map objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the OpenStreetMap network is downloaded using the area of the previously determined bounding box. (^The complexity of the network depends on the number of nodes on the generated bounding box (i.e. the area of interest defined by the latitude and longitude coordinates). Therefore, the number of observations should not affect the efficiency of the running times.) In order to get the distances from OSM, OSM net calculates the distances of the relations, creating the edges that are queried for the travel time estimation. To estimate these distances, the user has to specify data into a WGS 84 projection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Several parameters should be taken into account when calculating the distance network matrix:  \n",
    "* The _network type_ can be determined for walking or driving <span style=\"color:magenta\"> **(PENDING)** <span style=\"color:black\"> biking and transit).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Thresholds can be adjusted and are considered in the calculation of the distance matrix: the _average walking speed_ is 5 km/h (3 mph) and the default _average driving speed_ is of 40 km/h (25 mph).  This parameter might be specified differently for different populations.  * The City of Chicago estimates an average block dimension of 660 feet (200 m) by 330 feet (100 m).(https://www.cityofchicago.org/dam/city/depts/cdot/StreetandSitePlanDesignStandards407.pdf) STREET AND SITE PLAN DESIGN STANDARDS (2007:pg 2.) These dimensions might change across cities. >>> (Include table with conversions. Or reference to data on other cities) Therefore, the average walking speed of 3 mph estimates that a person, on average, walks a block in 72 to 144 seconds (1.2 - 2.4 min) to walk a block.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The _last mile_ correction is the distance that is not accounted for when calculating the shortest path from the centroid of the block to the actual network; therefore, the wanting extra distance is added to the travel time distance(>>>). \n",
    "    \n",
    "* The files needed for obtsining the travel time distance matrices are the following:  \n",
    "     * Only mandatory file: Single or separate file: origin + destination points of addresses. (User should make sure the projection is in EPSG 4326.)\n",
    "     * Table containing population data (in case the user is interested in future aggregation).\n",
    "     * Shapefile of finer spatial area ID  (in case the user is interested in future aggregation).\n",
    "     * Moreover, if the network type is driving, the edge traversal speed is drawn from a table of speed limits and street names that must be supplied separately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Also for walking and driving, a node penalty of X seconds (>>>) can also be specified by the user for the number of intersections within the area of analysis. The logic is that having more intersections will increase the travel time due to crossings. However, by doing a time travel calibration between the p2p algorithm and GoogleMaps, there was no need for adding penalities for the city of Chicago. The calibration can be assessed for different cities by using a random set of latitude and longitude points and comparing both estimated travel times for p2p (using the default average speeds and speed limits) and the GoogleMaps API. <span style=\"color:magenta\"> **(PENDING)** <span style=\"color:black\"> (Show table in which the calibration was tested for different cities, suggesting values for each.)>>>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lastly, it is important to emphasize that the network is directed, meaning that one way streets are respected and A->B and B->A can have different edge traversal speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that peak hour is not considered in the estimation of travel time distances. However, according to the GoogleMaps calibration, the travel time conditions we are asumming are in between rush hour and no traffic. <span style=\"color:magenta\"> **(PENDING)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**OSM structure**  \n",
    "In order to elucidate how the algorithm for estimating the travel time distance, a brief description of OSM's structure follows. >>>\n",
    "\n",
    "P2P uses a k-d tree to match each point in the source and destination data to its nearest neighbor node in the OSM network, and then finds the Vincenty distance between the two points. Vincenty's formulae estimate the geodesic distance between two points according to an ellipsoidal model of the Earth. (in this case are we using the direct or indirect formula?) Haversine formulas? more accurate? 0.3%>>>  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the travel time computation between origin and destination, Dijkstra's algorithm considers every possible route and chooses only the fastest route. Therefore, P2P also uses an adjacency list representation for Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path for every node to every other node in the underlying OSM network, but it can skip doing any processing for nodes that do not have an attached source data point. The advantage of this approach is that it scales to essentially any size dataset; as opposed to the adjacency matrix representation (which can easily exceed the memory of many systems for reasonably large datasets) P2P never loads the entire network into memory at one time, meaning the memory footprint is relatively small. This also means the multithreaded performance of P2P greatly outperforms the singlethreaded performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for every point in the source dataset to every point in the destination dataset, the base impedence is the cost found using Dijkstra. To the base value we add the 'last mile' inferred impedence from the source and destination points to their respective nearest nodes, determined by the Euclidean distance and a constant traversal speed. The 'last mile' is figurative; in the City of Chicago, for instance, 75 percent of block centroids were within 100 meters of the nearest OSM node and 95 percent of block centroids were within 200 meters.\n",
    " \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\"> **Open the following code to define the _epsilon_ parameter and _threshold constants_, if needed:** \n",
    "* **Threshold constants**: walk/drive average speed, walk/drive node penalty. The **average speeds** can be specified within the **p2p_parameters.json file**.  \n",
    "* **Epsilon**: Controls how large to make the network bounding box beyond your dataset. Larger epsilons result in longer computation times, but smaller epsilons result in slightly reduced accuracy at the very edges of the bounding box, especially for driving networks. The default is currently set at 0.05, which seems to balance the two reasonably well. (+/-) 0.02 will result in a large increase/decrease in computation time and accuracy. If too many values are defined as -1, it means that the epsilon is too small. Refer to the epsilon calibration to assess if this value must change and the matrix contains too many -1.\n"

    "\n",
    "The following demo creates a score that accounts for accessibility and a score that assesses the coverage of services in a catchment area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section creates the classes: **HSSAModel** and **PCSpend**\n",
    "\n",
    "Across disciplines, accessibility indicators provide a useful measure for a myriad of questions, like analyzing who does and does not live within reach of specific amenities/services or for estimating the spatial mismatch between supply and demand of these services. Thus, we generate an **HSSAModel** score that indicates the proximity to amenities. The score considers the centroids of the areas of analysis as the origin and the amenities as the destination points. It estimates the score by considering a distance decay function, the density and the variety of categories within each area of analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The distance decay function describes the decreasing intensity of a value as the distance increases. This notebook provides three functions described below: linear, square root, and logit. However, the user can add any function depending on the amenity's intensity behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The density of categories provides a larger score for areas that have a greater variety of categories, creating a more diverse environment. The variety of categories penalizes areas that have the same type of category within an area. Nevertheless, in some cases (like the Chicago health facilities), the repetition of categories should not be penalized because the demand for those services (hospitals) is higher than the service's provision capacity. (>>>Support with literature the choice of parameters and the values of category weights.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The score is purposely not normalized in order to observe the overall distribution across cities and years, but the standarized and unstandarized results are shown in the output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **PCSpend** model generates a coverage access which defines the reach of services by a specific targeted population. The score focuses on the coverage of the destination, scrutinizing how many people are within a catchment area. Specifically, the per capita spending score is the ratio of the coverage score by population."
